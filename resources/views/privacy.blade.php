                    <h2>Welcome to the Restowaze Privacy Policy!</h2>
                    When you use Restowaze services, you trust us with your information. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what data we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it. This is important; we hope you will take time to read it carefully. And remember, you can find controls to manage your information and protect your privacy and security at <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/?hl=en">My Account</a>.
                    <p>There are many different ways you can use our services – to search for and share information, to communicate with other people or to create new content. When you share information with us, for example by creating a <a href="../../policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-account">Restowaze Account</a>, we can make those services even better – to show you <a class="highlight highlight-unselected" href="../../policies/privacy/example/more-relevant-search-results.html" id="more-relevant-search-results">more relevant search results</a> and ads, to help you <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/connect-with-people.html" id="connect-with-people">connect with people</a> or to make <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/sharing-with-others.html" id="sharing-with-others">sharing with others quicker and easier</a>. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we’re using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.
					<p>Our Privacy Policy explains:
						<ul>
							<li>What information we collect and why we collect it.</li>
							<li>How we use that information.</li>
							<li>The choices we offer, including how to access and update information.</li>
						</ul>

                    <h2>Information we collect</h2>
                    <p>We collect information to provide better services to all of our users – from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/ads-youll-find-most-useful.html" id="ads-youll-find-most-useful">ads you’ll find most useful</a>, <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/the-people-who-matter-most.html" id="the-people-who-matter-most">the people who matter most to you online</a>, or which YouTube videos you might like.
					<p>We collect information in the following ways:
					<ul>
					<li>
					<p><strong>Information you give us.</strong> For example, many of our services require you to sign up for a Restowaze Account. When you do, we’ll ask for <a href="../../policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-personal-info">personal information</a>, like your name, email address, telephone number or <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/credit-card.html" id="credit-card">credit card</a> to store with your account. If you want to take full advantage of the sharing features we offer, we might also ask you to create a publicly visible <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/112783?hl=en">Restowaze Profile</a>, which may include your name and photo.
					<li>
					<p><strong>Information we get from your use of our services.</strong> We <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/collect-information.html" id="collect-information">collect information</a> about the services that you use and how you use them, like when you watch a video on YouTube, visit a website that uses our advertising services, or <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/view-and-interact-with-our-ads.html" id="view-and-interact-with-our-ads">view and interact with our ads</a> and content. This information includes:
					<ul>

					<p>When you use Restowaze services, we <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/may-collect-and-process-information.html" id="may-collect-and-process-information">may collect and process information about your actual location</a>. We use various technologies to determine location, including IP address, GPS, <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/sensors.html" id="sensors">and other sensors</a> that may, for example, provide Restowaze with information on nearby devices, <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/wifi-access-points-and-cell-towers.html" id="wifi-access-points-and-cell-towers">Wi-Fi access points and cell towers</a>.
					<li>
					<p><strong>Unique application numbers</strong>
